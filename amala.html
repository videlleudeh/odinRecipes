	<h2>Description:</h2>

		<p>Amala and Ewedu soup will always stay one of the most popular Nigerian soups, not only among the Yoruba people. A combination of Ewedu leaves and Amala gives a unique taste to this dish.</p>

	<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Ewedu Leaves.</li>
		<li>Salt and seasoning.</li>
		<li>Yam flour</li>
		<li>Water.</li>
		<li>Locust beans.</li>
		<li>Crayfish.</li>
		<li>Already prepared stew.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Steps for preparation:</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Pick your Ewedu leaves, make sure you don’t pick the stalk/stem along with it.</li> 
		<li>Wash the leaves thoroughly to rid it of dirt. Pour the water into a medium size pan, place on a bob on medium heat, bring to a rolling boil.</li>
		<li>If you’re using a broom (Ijabe), use the broom to pound the leaves. If you’re using a blender, take the Ewedu off the heat and leave to cool for a bit…don’t switch the heat off.</li>
		<li>Add the Ewedu into a blender along with the Iru, make sure you don’t add all the water, just 1/2 a cup should do. Too much water will affect the viscosity of your Ewedu.</li>
		<li>Using the pulse function, pulse a few times till you get a semi-purée consistency.</li>
		<li>Transfer the Ewedu back into the pan, add the ground crayfish, bouillon cube and salt to taste.</li>
		<li>Switch off the heat and let it simmer with the residual heat for 3 minutes….stir occasionally to prevent burning. Do not over cook or the Ewedu will go brown.</li>

		<p>To make Amala:</p>
		<li>Pour water in a pot and allow to get hot.</li>
		<li>Add the yam flour into it and stir continuously using a wooden stick to avoid lumps.</li>
		<li>Add extra yam flour if watery or add some water if it’s too strong (just like the way your make your semovita).</li>
		<li>Turn the yam flour very well, then add a bit of water, cover and allow to cook for about 10mins.</li>
		<li>Wrap it up in nylon</li>
	</ol>
