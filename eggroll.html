	<h2>Description:</h2>

		<p>In Africa, we prepare our version of Egg Roll just as the name implies. It is a boiled egg wrapped in a mass of dough and deep-fried.</p>

	<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Flour.</li>
		<li>Baking Powder.</li>
		<li>Nutmeg</li>
		<li>Water.</li>
		<li></li>
		<li>Boiled Egg.</li>
		<li>Sugar and Salt.</li>

	</ul>

	<h3>Steps for preparation:</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Mix the flour, baking powder, salt, sugar, and nutmeg in a large bowl.</li>
		<li>Add the margarine and use your fingers to blend the margarine into the flour until crumbly.</li>
		<li>Stir in the beaten egg. The dough should look dry at this point.</li>
		<li>Begin to introduce the water a little at a time and work the dough till the dough is soft and sticky but still workable.</li>
		<li>Work the dough for about a minute, then cover it and let it rest for about 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
		<li>Work the dough again for a couple of seconds to a minute and divide it into five balls.</li>
		<li>Flatten out each ball of dough on the palm of your hand, drop the egg in the middle of the flattened dough and tightly wrap the dough around each egg.</li>
