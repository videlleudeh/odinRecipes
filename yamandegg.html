	<h2>Description:</h2>

		<p>Egg sauce and boiled yam is one of the breakfast staples in Nigeria or should I say weekend breakfast. </p>

	<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>A tuber of white yam.</li>
		<li>Egg</li>
		<li>Salt and seasoning.</li>
		<li>Pepper.</li>
		<li>Tomatoes.</li>
		<li>Oil.</li>
		<li>Garlic and Ginger.</li>

	</ul>

	<h3>Steps for preparation:</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Slice yam into about 1-inch size and peel the skin off.</li>
		<li>Rinse in clean water till water runs clear and no residue in water</li>
		<li>Put yam in a pan, add enough water to cover it, add salt and place on medium heat and cook till soft. Test with a fork, if it goes through, then the yam should be soft enough. </li>

		<p>To make Egg sauce:</p>

		<li>Break eggs into a shallow bowl, whisk till egg white and egg yolk are well combined, add salt and whisk to combine then set it aside</li>
		<li>Place a frying pan on a medium/low heat, add of vegetable oil, heat for about 2-3 minutes</li>
		<li>Add chopped peppers, tomatoes and onions (this should sizzle) and cook for about 4-5 minutes or till oil floats on the sauce, add salt, seasoning, curry and thyme. Stir to combine ingredient with sauce and also avoid sauce sticking to the pan</li>
